Udacity Nanodegrees

Udacity offers some great content in their Nanodegree programs. If you don't have the money,  you can take many of the courses for free.

While it's no substitute for the actual Nanodegree programs (which include project reviews, additional student and career guidance, and a job guarantee) there is some great content available for learning.
